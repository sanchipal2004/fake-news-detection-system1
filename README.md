> An AI-powered web application that detects whether a news statement is **Real or Fake** using  Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning models.

---

##  Overview

The **Fake News Detection System** is a full-stack web application that helps users verify the authenticity of news articles or statements.  
It uses a **trained Machine Learning model** (e.g., Logistic Regression,  BERT) to classify text as *Fake* or *Real* based on its linguistic features.

Users can simply paste any news headline or article text into the input box and get an instant prediction along with confidence scores.
